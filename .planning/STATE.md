# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-29)

**Core value:** Keep the admin workflow reliable, legible, and backend-driven so operators can manage episodes and inspect system state without fighting the UI.
**Current focus:** Phase 4 — Artifact Job Contract

## Current Position

Phase: 4 (v1.1 phase 1 of 3) — Artifact Job Contract
Plan: —
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-07-28 — v1.1 roadmap created with phases 4-6

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 6
- Average duration: n/a
- Total execution time: 0.0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: phase 1, phase 2, phase 3 complete
- Trend: complete

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Treat the current repo as the project baseline, not a new product idea.
- Keep business logic on the backend.
- Preserve the sectioned admin layout.
- Honor `authBypass` in local development.
- Keep ZIP creation and artifact resolution in the backend; Angular remains a thin orchestrator.
- Use an asynchronous job/progress contract for ZIP generation and native browser Blob download behavior.
- Preserve the sectioned legacy-inspired manage layout and `authBypass` behavior.

### Pending Todos

None for v1.0. MNT-01 and MNT-02 carry forward to the next milestone.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4 depends on coordinating the job/progress contract with the sibling `dragaocare-api` repository.
- Confirm transcript readiness semantics, CORS exposure for download headers, and the canonical DC 334 fixture location during planning.

## Deferred Items
